Subject: [PATCH 1/8] audio: intel-hda: check stream entry count during
 transfer

Intel HDA emulator uses stream of buffers during DMA data
transfers. Each entry has buffer length and buffer pointer
position, which are used to derive bytes to 'copy'. If this
length and buffer pointer were to be same, 'copy' could be
set to zero(0), leading to an infinite loop. Add check to
avoid it.
